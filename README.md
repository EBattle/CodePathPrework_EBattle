## Notes

I was having some issues getting the screen layout to work (the top half of the canvas would absolutely not show-up in the simulator no matter what I did) and was forced to resolve it by changing iPhone generations on the simulator (which reduced the non-visible area by about half) and then just jamming everything into the lower parts of the canvas.

I also thought I had trouble getting licecap to install on the mac, but it turns-out the program was actually running and I had thought "stopped" meant it crashed not that it just wasn't recording yet.
